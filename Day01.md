## 2. Artificial Intelligence (AI)

**Definition:**  
AI is the capability of a system to perform tasks that normally require human intelligence, such as decision-making, problem-solving, and pattern recognition.  

### AI Automation vs AI
- **AI Automation:** Using AI systems to automate repetitive or complex tasks.  
- **Difference:** AI refers to the intelligence itself, while AI Automation is the practical application of AI to perform tasks automatically.  
- **Key point:** These concepts are **not equal**.

### Types of AI
AI is categorized into three types:

1. **Narrow AI (Weak AI)**  
   - Focused on performing a specific task.  
   - Example: Chatbots, recommendation systems.  

2. **General AI (Strong AI)**  
   - Capable of performing any intellectual task a human can do.  
   - Can replace humans in decision-making and problem-solving.  

3. **Super AI**  
   - Surpasses human intelligence and capability.  
   - Hypothetical and futuristic concept.

## 3. Machine Learning (ML)

**Definition:**  
Machine Learning is a subset of AI where systems learn patterns from data using statistics and algorithms to perform tasks without explicit programming for each rule.

- **Key idea:** ML is used when rules are **not clear or too complex**.  

---

## 4. Software Systems

Software systems can be categorized into **two main types**:

1. **Rule-based Systems (Traditional Programming)**  
   - Uses clearly defined rules to convert input into output.  
   - Example:
     ```java
     sorting() {
         // rule sets are clearly defined
     }
     ```
   - **When to use:** If rules are well-known and deterministic.  

2. **Learning-based Systems (Machine Learning)**  
   - Used when rules are **not clear** or too complex to manually program.  
   - Example:
     ```java
     identifyDigit() {
         // rules are unclear; millions of lines of code required
     }
     ```
   - **Process:**  
     - Select an ML algorithm  
     - Provide input-output datasets  
     - Train a **model** that predicts outputs from new inputs  
   - **Key point:** ML identifies rules from data patterns rather than explicitly defined rules.  

**Rule Selection:**  
- If rules are known → use **rule-based systems**  
- If rules are unknown → use **learning-based systems**

## 5. Whitebox vs Blackbox Models

- **Whitebox:** Rules and inner workings are transparent and understandable.  
- **Blackbox:** Rules are unknown, internal processing is opaque.  

**Example:**  
- Decision trees → Whitebox  
- Neural networks → Blackbox  

---

## 6. Model Optimization

**Definition:**  
Optimizing a model means **tuning it** to improve performance and accuracy.  

- Neural networks and other models are represented mathematically as functions:  

    ```
         function = f(x)
    ```


- **Calculus** is often used to adjust parameters and optimize models.  

**Goal:** Minimize errors and maximize prediction accuracy.

## 7. Key Takeaways

- AI automates tasks using intelligence; AI Automation applies AI practically.  
- ML is crucial when rules are unclear or too complex for manual programming.  
- Rule-based systems are transparent; learning-based systems find patterns in data.  
- Whitebox vs Blackbox distinction depends on visibility of rules.  
- Model optimization improves performance using mathematical functions and tuning.
